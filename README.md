## Using this repository for experiments
If you are designing an experiment, all experiment files should go in the `experiment` folder. Please follow the following steps:
1. Create a new branch on Github named `experiment` if it does not already exist. Typically it should exist.
2. Install `github desktop` on the computer on which the experiment will live, and clone this repository there.
3. Switch to the `experiment` branch.
4. Create the experiment directly in the experiment folder of this repository only.
5. **Every time you update the experiment, commit the changes to git including a short description of what you changed.** You can use github desktop for doing this efficiently.
